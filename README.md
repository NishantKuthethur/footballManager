# footballManager
>>>>>>> origin/main

This is a project for a football manager app.

## Getting Started
I have used vite as the bundler for this React app
CSS - tailwind

Day 1
I started off with the main overlay that is setting the theme colors in the tailwind config and created the main page and the sidebar components.
Using useLocation() to manage the look of the sidebar links/icons.

Day 2
Created a layout for the main part os the entire app (to display roster details and formation overview).
Moved code/markup to componenets where required.
Installing zustand to manage global state where required.
I am initially using it to create a store to hold the state of the team name
