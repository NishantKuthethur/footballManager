# footballManager
>>>>>>> origin/main

This is a project for a football manager app.

## Getting Started
I have used vite as the bundler for this React app
CSS - tailwind

Day 1
I started off with the main overlay that is setting the theme colors in the tailwind config and created the main page and the sidebar components.
